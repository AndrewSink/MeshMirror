MeshMirror is an intuitive and user-friendly web application designed to simplify the process of mirroring 3D mesh models in .STL format. With a simple click, users can effortlessly mirror their 3D models without the need for any CAD or mesh editing software. 

## Project Description

MeshMirror provides a simple interface to upload a 3D model in .STL format and quickly mirror it. This powerful tool is ideal for anyone working with 3D models, especially those who might be unfamiliar with traditional CAD software or other complex 3D modeling tools.

Whether you're a designer, engineer, hobbyist, or 3D printing enthusiast, MeshMirror can make your life easier. With its quick and effortless operation, you can mirror your 3D mesh models and download the resulting mirrored .STL file within seconds.

## How to Use MeshMirror

1. Visit our website.
2. Click on the "Upload" button to upload your .STL file.
3. Once your model is uploaded and rendered, click on the "Mirror" button to create a mirrored version of your model.
4. When your mirrored model is ready, click on the "Export Mirrored .STL" button to download the mirrored .STL file.

MeshMirror doesn't store any of your data or 3D models, ensuring your designs remain secure and private.
